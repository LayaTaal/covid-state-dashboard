## About this Repo

As a way to better understand state wide occurences of COVID-19, I setup this small dashboard to start visualizing data provided from each state. All data is pulled from the API of *[The COVID Tracking Project](https://covidtracking.com)*. We are fortunate to live in a time of such great data transparency and availability.

I will continue to work on and update this repo as we learn more.
